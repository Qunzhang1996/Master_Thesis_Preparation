% Description: 
%   scans the debug data and ground truth whether a emergency stop
%   was performed within the given specifications
% 
% Input: 
%   debug:          Debug structure of the vehicle
%   ground_truth:   Physical ground truth data from simulation
%   tFailure_s:     Timestamp where the failure occured
%   PerformanceSpec Structure with fields: 
%       eMax_m          Maximum control error allowed during emergency
%       tDetectionMax_s Maximum time to detect the emergency stop
% 
% Outputs: 
%   result:       1 if a valid emergency stop was detected, 0 otherwise
